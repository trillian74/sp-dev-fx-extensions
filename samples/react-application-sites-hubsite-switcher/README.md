# Spfx Applications Customiser Sites in Hub site switcher

## Summary
This sample shows how to get the sites that are part of a Hub Site, and renders a drop down to jump directly into a site. The customiser only 
renders if the site is a Hub site.

__Note__: The interesting part is that Microsoft is offering an API to get information about the sites that are part of the HubSite, but that API is out of SharePoint (_westeurope3-sphomep.svc.ms/api/v1/sites/hub_). 

To consume that API we need a different Token (_spHttpClient_ is not working with that API), that can be obtained calling another API that is part of SharePoint:
_sphomeservice/context_

Sample SharePoint Framework application customiser rendering a drop down in header showing the sites in the Hub site, and a direct link to jump into them.

This sample illustrates the following concepts on top of the SharePoint Framework:

* Header customiser with React components
* Using _sphomeservice/context_ api to get a valid Bearer token for the Hub Api
* Using the Hub Api that is out of SharePoint (_{locaiton}-sphomep.svc.ms/api/v1/sites/hub_)
* Using async / await for the async calls
* Office UI fabric ActionLinks
