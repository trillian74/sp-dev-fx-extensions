# SPFx Field Customiser sample displaying the current user permission with PNPJs

## Summary
This sample shows how to use PNPJs to get the current users permission on the specific list item. Then a corresponding icon and text is shown in the field. For this sample I'm using simplified roles, so the code is is only checking for edit or read permissions.

## Debug URL for testing
Here's a debug URL for testing around this sample. 

```
?debugManifestsFile=https://localhost:4321/temp/manifests.js&loadSPFX=true&fieldCustomizers={"SPFxUserPermission":{"id":"62a15882-603f-4dfd-8580-4decc98033a7","properties":{"sampleText":"Value"}}}

```
Full URL to request would be something like following (Remember to open a modern List):

```
contoso.sharepoint.com/Lists/Orders/AllItems.aspx?debugManifestsFile=https://localhost:4321/temp/manifests.js&loadSPFX=true&fieldCustomizers={"SPFxUserPermission":{"id":"62a15882-603f-4dfd-8580-4decc98033a7","properties":{"sampleText":"Value"}}}
```
