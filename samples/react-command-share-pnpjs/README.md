# React Multishare Command Extension with PnPJs

## Summary
The sample is an custom action only active when multiple items are selected.

It uses multiple Office UI Fabric React components:
- Dialog
- Peoplepicker
- Checkbox
- Messagebar
- etc...

The action opens a dialog where the user can choose people from SharePoint in a people picker, to share the selected items with.
It utilizes PnPJs to get suggestions for the peoplepicker, and for the sharing of the listitems.

## Debug URL for testing
Here's a debug URL for testing around this sample. 

```
?debugManifestsFile=https://localhost:4321/temp/manifests.js&loadSPFX=true&customActions={"a0eacac3-5984-4d85-ab63-c7b245c8e2f5":{"location":"ClientSideExtension.ListViewCommandSet.CommandBar"}}"

```
Full URL to request would be something like following (Remember to open a modern List):

```
contoso.sharepoint.com/Lists/Orders/AllItems.aspx?debugManifestsFile=https://localhost:4321/temp/manifests.js&loadSPFX=true&customActions={"a0eacac3-5984-4d85-ab63-c7b245c8e2f5":{"location":"ClientSideExtension.ListViewCommandSet.CommandBar"}}
```
